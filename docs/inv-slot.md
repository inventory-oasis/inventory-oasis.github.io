# Inventory Slot

This scene is what is spawned under the `Inventory Window`'s Grid. It gets the data directly from the Inventory Component passed to the Inventory Window. More precisely the `inv_item_list` from the Inventory Component.

It can catch GUI inputs. Supports Drag & Drop. There are also basic tooltips.
